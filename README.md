# 100daysofCSS
As of day 0/100, I hate CSS. I feel as though this is because I haven't been able to create any designs I am proud of. My goal with this challenge is to improve my designs so I can start to enjoy CSS. Most challenges will include HTML, CSS, JS


# Day 5 Update
Starting to slightly look forward to this challenge everyday, but still not too confident in my designs. Luckily, I have 95 more days to go!
